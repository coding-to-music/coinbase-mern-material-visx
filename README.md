<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A cryptocurrency website where you can find the latest information (Market cap, price change, etc) on the top 100 global cryptocurrencies. You can view this information and favorite as as a registered user! Registered Users can keep track and remove their favorited cryptocurrencies.

The different functionalities of Cryptoinfoweb:

- View latest price information about global cryptocurrencies.
- Create an account and favorite your preferred cryptocurrencies.
- Learn about blockchain and cryptocurrencies

These were some of the facets I wanted to incorporate into this app as they would mimic some of the major features of popular cyprocurrency apps like Coinbase. 

This was a fun project and there are a lot of features I would like to add in the future!
